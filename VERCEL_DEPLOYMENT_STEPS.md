# üöÄ Deploy Your Admission Dashboard to Vercel

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard

### 2. Import Your GitHub Repository
1. Click **"Add New..."** ‚Üí **"Project"**
2. Select **"Import Git Repository"**
3. Find and select: `eastafricavision9-cell/eavicollageapply`
4. Click **"Import"**

### 3. Configure Project Settings
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js (should be auto-detected)
- **Root Directory**: `./` (keep default)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (should be auto-filled)
- **Output Directory**: `.next` (should be auto-filled)
- **Install Command**: `npm install` (should be auto-filled)

### 4. Environment Variables (Optional for now)
You can skip this step initially and add them later:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (when you set up Supabase)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (when you set up Supabase)

### 5. Deploy!
1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Wait for the build process (2-3 minutes)
3. Get your live URL!

### 6. Your Live Application
After deployment, you'll get a URL like:
- `https://eavicollageapply-xxxxx.vercel.app`
- This will show your ACTUAL admission dashboard system!

## What Will Be Live:

‚úÖ **Student Application Form** (`/apply`)
- Complete application form with validation
- Course selection
- KCSE grade entry
- Email validation

‚úÖ **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin/dashboard`)
- Student management system
- CRUD operations
- Status updates
- PDF generation

‚úÖ **Home Page** (`/`)
- Landing page with navigation
- Clean professional design

## If You Encounter Issues:

### Build Errors
- The system is configured to bypass TypeScript errors
- Should build successfully

### Missing Features
- Some features (like email/PDF) might need environment variables
- Database features will need Supabase setup later

### Need Help?
1. Check the Vercel deployment logs
2. Refer to the DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md file
3. Contact support if needed

## Alternative: CLI Method (if web interface doesn't work)

If the web interface has issues, you can also use:

```bash
# Initialize a new Vercel project
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Y
# - Which scope? (select your account)
# - Link to existing project? N
# - What's your project's name? eavicollageapply
# - In which directory is your code located? ./
# - Auto-detect project settings? Y

# Then deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

Your admission dashboard will then be live and accessible worldwide! üåç
