# How to Add Your EAVI Logo

## Step 1: Save the Logo Image
1. Right-click on your EAVI logo image
2. Save it as `eavi-logo.png` in the `public` folder of this project
3. The full path should be: `C:\Users\suzzie\Desktop\finalyyy\public\eavi-logo.png`

## Step 2: Logo is Already Integrated!
The dashboard code has been updated to use your logo in two places:
- **Header**: Small logo (64x64px) next to the "Admission Dashboard" title
- **Main Content**: Larger logo (120x120px) in the welcome section

## Current Logo Setup:
- ✅ Header logo - Ready to display your EAVI logo
- ✅ Main content logo - Ready to display your EAVI logo  
- ✅ Responsive design - Logo scales properly on all devices
- ✅ Professional styling - White background with shadow for the main logo

## Alternative: If you want to save the logo via PowerShell:
```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\Users\suzzie\Desktop\finalyyy\public"

# If you have the logo file somewhere else, copy it:
# Copy-Item "path\to\your\logo.png" "eavi-logo.png"
```

Once you add the `eavi-logo.png` file to the public folder, the dashboard will automatically display your actual logo instead of the placeholder!
